Detecting Building Defects Using VGG16 &amp; IBM Watson


## Introduction

Detecting problems on the wall surfaces of high-rise structures, such as cracks and flakes, is a critical responsibility of building maintenance. These defects, if left undetected and untreated, can have a significant impact on a building's structural integrity and aesthetic appeal. Building owners and maintenance agencies must use timely and cost-effective methods of building condition surveys to replace the manual survey's time-and labor-intensive approach.
Clients are increasingly looking for fast and effective means to quickly and frequently survey and communicate the condition of their buildings so that essential repairs and maintenance work can be done in a proactive and timely manner before it becomes too dangerous and expensive. Traditional methods for this type of work commonly comprise engaging building surveyors to undertake a condition assessment, which involves a lengthy site inspection to produce a systematic recording of the physical condition of the building elements, including cost estimates of immediate and projected long-term costs of renewal, repair, and maintenance of the building.
